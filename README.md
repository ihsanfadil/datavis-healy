# Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction

This repository provides datasets, code, and plots as shown in Kieran Healy's book, which is freely accessible at https://socviz.co. Sometimes, datasets used are not readily usable and required some modification before plotting. You can access all these data in the folder `data` where I provide the raw and cleaned datasets for future use.
